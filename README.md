# Analogue-Pocket-Pokemon-GB-Palettes
These are written by me to be identical to the palettes you get when you play a B&amp;W Pokemon game on the GBC.

This is how you apply my Palette Patches according to their site:

"Starting in OS 2.0, Pocket can load custom palette files in a new format called APGB. This is supported by cartridges and openFPGA that target GB.

•Place .pal files on the SD card in the folder /Assets/gb/common/palettes
•Enter Settings>Pocket>Systems>GB>Video>Color Palettes and select Custom, then Load Custom.
•Select a file from the list."
